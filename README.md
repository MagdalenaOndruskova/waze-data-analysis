# WAZE DATA ANALYSIS (front end application)

This project was created as Master's thesis at the Faculty of Information Technology, 
Brno university of Technology. 

The main purpose of this project was to analyze and visualize traffic 
data collected from users using navigation application Waze. 
This application was created in cooperation with [data.brno.cz](https://data.brno.cz/)


In this repository you can find a code for running frontend application. 
This application is querying data from backend application.


Datasets can be found at: [Traffic delays](https://data.brno.cz/datasets/mestobrno::plynulost-dopravy-traffic-delays/about) and [Traffic events](https://data.brno.cz/datasets/mestobrno::ud%C3%A1losti-na-cest%C3%A1ch-traffic-events/about). 

Repository for frontend application can be found here [waze-data-analysis](https://github.com/MagdalenaOndruskova/waze-data-analysis).

Final application is available at: 
- localhost under address `localhost/waze-data-analysis/`
- testing deployment at [data.brno](https://data.brno.cz/apps/70b6c168c69e4955a354622b3e92dd49/explore)
